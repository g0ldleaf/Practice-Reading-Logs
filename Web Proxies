>This looks like a GET request for travelocity website, trying to get a gif, but ultimately failing and receiving a 304 not modified HTTP code

2005-05-04 17:16:08 154 45.14.4.127 200 TCP_NC_MISS 2973 720 GET http images.google.com /images ?q=tbn:-dEjG3JAHxgJ:www.kevcom.com/images/linux/linux.logo.2yp.jpg - DIRECT images.google.com image/jpeg "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/312.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/312" PROXIED Hacking/Proxy%20Avoidance - 192.16.170.42 SG-HTTP-Service - none -
> Looks like a GET request for google images, including some sort of password for a linux server. This gets directed to a MAC and then PROXIED to something noted "Hacking/Proxy%20Avoidance" >My guess is that this is a successful adware attack because it has code 127, which means okay (something was successfully modified). The person may have been attempting to get info from websites, then send adware if successful.

2005-05-04 17:16:08 18 45.23.4.216 304 TCP_RESCAN_HIT 422 405 GET http twinpeaksweather.com /java-sys/Dgclock.class - - DIRECT 66.235.216.135 application/octet-stream "Mozilla/4.0 (Windows 2000 5.0) Java/1.5.0_02" PROXIED News/Media - 192.16.170.42 SG-HTTP-Service - none -
> Similar to 1st log situation due to code 304, not modified.

>My notes:
Web proxies exercise: splunk, application log, 3 large files, travelocity GET not modified, images GET okay, twinpeaksweather GET not modified, requests occur almost simultaneously → Story: redirected XXS, attacker trying to send client to an infected image page and the 2nd attempt works. → alternative story: adware attack
